    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
My name is Victor Oseloka. I am a Nigerian, and a devoted Christian. I am passionate about learning computer programming, technology, and understanding how the digital world works. I enjoy reading, exploring new ideas, and building simple projects that help me grow my skills and creativity. And also ready to learn and explore other areas of diversification in knowledge acquired, thereby solving and addressing issues and problems around me.
